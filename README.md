git-settings
============

My personal git settings files and what not

In particular, the .gitignore is my "running list" of things that typically cause me pain inside git repos - things like images, compiled output (build directories), etc.

The .gitignore in this repo is simply my "template" or "boiler plate" .gitignore file that may brought into any of my projedts and then modified as required. But basically, I'm lazy, and I don't want to have to think really hard about what I need to ignore every time I work on a repo.
